# UT_Sales_Tax_Analysis

Data source: [Utah State Tax Comission](https://tax.utah.gov/econstats/sales)

Notes:
- Impacts from COVID19
- Explore per capita differences
- Explore use of dashboard to calculate difference on the fly
- Pay attention to City naming differences between UGRC cities shapefile and Tax Comission e.g. (Heber/heber city)
- If county-level agregation is needed, use county tab in spreadsheet, don't process from cities export
